Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is the client and they were requesting a web application for their system to help teach drivers how to drive better in hopes to improve the overall driving scores.

What did you do particularly well?

Gathering information for the business requirements document
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would still improve on my business requirements document to ensure that i covered more functional and nonfunctional requirements from the client.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was able to utilize their needs to build use case diagram, sequence diagram activity and uml class diagrams. This information allowed me to connect with the development team as a systems analyst and bring them the information needed to complete the design. 
By creating these various diagrams it allows us to showcase the design in various ways, by showing classes with their attributes/functions, how certiain functions will interact, how users(actors) interact with their classes as well, both internally and externally.
It is important to consider the user's needs when designing to ensure that accuracy is maintained to their vision of how they want their desired outcome to look, feel and perform.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I typically dedicate significant time to the information-gathering phase, as it allows me to gauge the client's expectations and needs. For future strategies, I plan to invest more time in the design phase to provide the client with visual direction
earlier in the process, rather than relying entirely on an in-depth discovery period. Creating business requirements document plays a key role in this approach as it help consolidate design considerations into a structured, textual format with clear defined categories.
